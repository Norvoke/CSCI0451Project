# Project Proposal: Machine Learning Model for Identifying Russian Verbs
### By Finn Ellingwood
## Abstract

The project aims to create a machine learning model using the Russian OpenCorpora dataset for recognizing patterns given specific tags attributed to each verb and input unknown verbs and output its best guess of attributes for the given input. The project also intends to compare the model with the one created by a recent Middlebury graduate for Arabic verbs. The project aims to achieve a high level of accuracy in recognizing parts of speech and provide a useful tool for researchers and developers working with Russian language data.
Motivation and Question

The Russian language is one of the most widely spoken languages globally, with a significant amount of data available on various domains. A machine learning model for recognizing parts of speech in the Russian language will be a valuable tool for researchers and developers to analyze and develop applications based on the Russian language. The project aims to answer the following question: Can a machine learning model be created to recognize patterns in parts of speech for Russian verbs, and how accurate can it be?

# Planned Deliverables:

The project aims to create the following deliverables:

    * A Python package containing all code used for algorithms and analysis, including documentation.
    * A Jupyter notebook illustrating the use of the package to analyze data.
    * A blog post describing the project's motivation, methodology, results, and insights.

The project's full success will result in a machine learning model with a high level of accuracy in recognizing parts of speech for Russian verbs. If the model is not perfect, partial success will still provide a useful tool for researchers and developers, which can be used as a starting point to improve the model's accuracy.
Written Deliverables

The project will have a blog post describing the project's motivation, methodology, results, and insights.
Resources Required

The following resources will be required to complete the project:

    * Russian OpenCorpora dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rtatman/opencorpora-russian)
    * A recent Middlebury graduate's project for Arabic verbs to be modified to compare with the machine learning model, with permission of the creators.
    * A computer with sufficient processing power to train and test the machine learning model.

What You Will Learn

The project aims to help the group members achieve the following goals:

    * Learn and apply machine learning algorithms and techniques for natural language processing.
    * Gain experience in data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Python packages such as NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn.
    * Improve collaboration and project management skills by working on a team project.
    * Explore the area where linguistics and machine learning meet, hopefully adding to the collective knowledge of this area.

Risk Statement

Three potential risks for the project are:

    * The model may not achieve the expected level of accuracy in recognizing parts of speech, despite using machine learning algorithms and techniques.
    * The project may require more computational power than is available to the team.
    * The project may require more advanced methods than those known by the team members.
    * The project may not be able to achieve its goals due to unforeseen events.

Ethics Statement

The project has the potential to benefit researchers and developers working with the Russian language, providing them with a useful tool for analyzing and developing applications based on Russian language data. However, the project may exclude non-Russian speakers from benefitting from the tool, as it focuses solely on the Russian language. The project aims to make the world a better place by providing a useful tool for research and development based on the Russian language data. The two assumptions behind this are:

    The availability of such tools will help researchers and developers better understand the Russian language, leading to the development of better applications and services for Russian speakers.
    The more we understand and work with different languages and cultures, the more likely we are to build a more inclusive and connected world.
